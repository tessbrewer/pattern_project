# pattern_project


This repository contains the scripts and data needed to recreate analyses from "Horizontal gene transfer of a key translation protein has shaped the polyproline proteome" (Brewer & Wagner). All code is written for R version 4.0.3.

| file name | description | figures |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| pattern_project_functions.R | includes all functions & commonly used files | --- |
| miscellaneous_analyses.R | creates several figures, and calculates specific polyproline motif conservation across 3000 genomes dataset | 1, 5 & S1 | 
| thermo_analyses.R | finds polyproline motifs significantly linked to HGT of efp gene in Thermotogota and creates related figures | 2, 3, S2 & S5 |
| plancto_analyses.R | finds polyproline motifs significantly linked to HGT of efp gene in Planctomycetes and creates related figures | 4, S3, S4 & S6 |
                               
Data files required to run each script are listed within.
